OFFICIAL TODO LIST:
1. Get Game, StdInPlayer, and world.py working so that the game is playable again with new Being-Encounter stuff
2. Make new interface with http://www.effbot.org/zone/console-handbook.htm ???

* Combat groups
Support in the Combat class but not really tested

* Calling reinforcements
A follow up idea to "Combat groups".  It means that in certain situations you can call for help and other combatants will join in your combat group.

* Multiplayer

* Salvage
Dead guys leave loot

* All programmable players
This means that all NPCs are implementing the same Player interface as human players are.

* Make hit points stop resetting after each combat and only reset at a node

* http://www.effbot.org/zone/console-handbook.htm

* Make Merchant(Player) class that takes GoodProfiles to the constructor

* Non-combat encounters
The two that come to mind are roaming merchants and police.  This would entail:
* A new state similar to EdgeCombatState
* A new method(s) on Player similar to chooseCombatAction and combatEvents
* A new series of events similar to CombatEvent and derived classes
There has to be some idea that you can transition between these states.  For example, you can start off interacting with the police in EdgeSearchState but if you refuse you transition to EdgeCombatState.

* All purpose inventory object
Members = inventory (dictionary of goodName -> quantity), vessel (VesselProfile object), fuel, money

* Being object
  Name
  Inventory
  Player
  location
  state
  money
  fuel
  vessel

* Encounter object
  Takes 2 Being objects
  New method on Player to vote for initial state
